Mean Normalization
In machine learning we use large amounts of data to train our models. S
ome machine learning algorithms may require that the data is normalized in order to work correctly.
The idea of normalization, also known as feature scaling, is to ensure that all the data is on a similar scale, i.e. 
that all the data takes on a similar range of values. For example, we might have a dataset that has values between 0 and 5,000. 
By normalizing the data we can make the range of values be between 0 and 1.
